## About

This folder contains the end-to-end code for case studies presented in the paper. The goal of these case studies is to show the RDFframes API usage in machine learning and data science application. It further demonstrates the usability, flexibility, and efficiency of using RDFframes to process knowledge graphs and the advantage of integrating RDFframes in the PyData ecosystem. Thus, the code includes importing and using external machine learning libraries to develop a concrete code for each case study.   

*   # Topic Modeling:
    In this case study, we show the use of RDFframes to query the DBLP bibliography dataset in RDF format to conduct topic modeling to identify the active areas of     database research. RDFframes produces a pandas dataframe utilized for topic modeling with the aid of a rich PyData ecosystem (NLP libraries for stop-word           removal and scikit-learn for topic modeling). The code is availble at __topic_modeling.py__ python file.
