## Benchmark Queries - DBpedia 2020

### About

This folder contains the 16 queries we developed to investigate the synthetic workload of RDFframes API.
These queries are designed to exercise different features of RDFFrames to benchmark. 
We evaluated these queries over an RDF engine that stores DBpedia version 2020.
Each query is associated with 4 different files, e.g., the 4 files for Query 1 (Q1) are Q1-RDFframes.py, Q1-expert.sparql,
Q1-naive.sparql, and Q1-RDFframes.sparql. 

* Q1-expert.sparql: contains the SPARQL query that is written by SPARQL expert. 
* Q1-RDFframes.py: shows how to use RDFframe API to generate a sematic equivleint of the query. 
* Q1-RDFframes.saprql: contains the SPARQL query as generated by RDFframes API. 
* Q1-naive.sparql: is the same query as if it is produced by a basic query generator. More specifically, assume converting each API call to RDFFrames to a subquery that contains the pattern corresponding to that API call and then combine all the subqueries in one outer query.

**Note** that all the different versions of the query(expert, RDFframes, naive) should return the same results and adhere to the same semantic.

### Run 
To run these queries, use *curl_execute_example* script to issue the query to an RDF engine or SPARQL endpoint for an RDF store.
